9/16/2021 - Initial tests written for placing ships on grid. Refactoring needs to be done.

9/16/2021 - Refactored

9/18/2021 - Hard coded receiveAttack() tests explicitly to ensure functionality. Despite being tedious wanted to make sure it had no dependencies before relying on helper functions the rest of the way in gameBoard.test.js

9/20/2021 - Javascript part finished with unit testing with jest. DOM Grids/squares connected to Javascript grids/squares. Using recursion computer places 17 ship objects in random locations without them intercepting each other or going out of bounds on rows and columns at start of game.
